                                                                                            #
1) Which all TVs are Pi enabled ?                                                           #
LG TV outside the Dean’s suite, SHARP TC in the student Lounge, Samsung TV above the WEPA   #
printer, SHARP TV on the bridge and LG TV outside the lecture hall .                        #
                                                                                            #
2) What folder on Dropbox will be the parent folder now?                                    #
The Dev folder will be the new parent folder for all the TVs. Concourse_TV folder can be    #
deleted. I have already pasted the content of Concourse_TV to Dev folder.                   #
                                                                                            #
3) I uploaded the file in the dropbox, but it doesn’t turn up on the TV?                    #
Probably, you uploaded a file format that is not .jpg or .JPG. In case, if you see          #
your file extension to be .jpeg, then just rename it to .JPG or .jpg. You may also see      #
faq 4) in case the issue persists.                                                          #
                                                                                            #
4) Pi Screen is frozen and it is struck at one image?                                       #
* Do a hard reset of Pi. That is, plug out the power cord and re-insert it                  #
* Pi will reboot into the signage mode after between 1-5 minutes                            #
* You’ll be all set now.                                                                    #
                                                                                            #
5) I uploaded the images to Dev, but old ones are still running?                            #
* Press Esc key and Pull up the browser from the top Menu Tab->Internet Explorer            #
* Try to open google.com. In case if you cannot reach google, it means, internet access is  #
not available.                                                                              #
* Plug out the Wifi module and again reinsert. Hopefully, it will catch the signal.         #
* If the above doesn’t work, please do a hard reset of the Pi by plugging out the power     #
  cord.                                                                                     #
* Pi will reboot into the signage mode and will take between 0-5 minute to start            #
* You’ll be all set now.                                                                    #
                                                                                            #
6) What about scheduling content ?                                                          #
The SHARP TV in the student lounge is setup with a cron job which will remove all the files #
named according to the naming convention that I have placed under                           #
Important_Instructions_Digital_Signage folder. Current removal time is every day at 00:15   #
am. It is important to note that if the MacMini in student lounge is down, it won't delete  #
the files from Dropbox.                                                                     #
                                                                                            #
7) Correct Picture modes for different makes of TVs?                                        #
It came to my notice that on LG TVs—> Just to scan picture mode works and on Samsung TVs—>  #
Picture mode works. All the other modes will result in either over scanned image with black #
borders or stretched images going beyond the screen. I have already set up all the TVs to   #
this new settings.                                                                          #
                                                                                            #
8) Can we rename the existing files in the Dev folder as per the naming convention to       #
automatically schedule content?                                                             #
Renaming isn’t allowed in this system. So, if you want to leverage the automatic deletion   #
feature then kindly delete the current files and again upload the same with the desired end #
date after a minute or so after deletion time.                                              #
                                                                                            #
9) What happens if by mistake someone renamed the file? Will it break the system ?          #
Mostly, the renamed file will not be updated on to the Pis. The same file with the previous #
name will keep on going. The next time someone deletes an image from the Dev folder or      #
automatic scripts does that, the new name of the files will appear on the Pis.              #
                                                                                            #
10) Can we delete all the files under the Dev folder and add new ones?                      #
For keeping the system simple, all the files will be deleted automatically. In case if the  #
user of the account wants to force delete and add new files, then the user needs to make    #
sure that the Dev folder always have one file at least in the folder. For e.g., there are   #
10 files, and user wants to remove all and add two new ones. In this case, the user will    #
first add two new and then delete all, or user deletes nine and then add two and then       #
delete the 10th one. Deleteing all files at once will have unknown effects on the system    #
                                                                                            #
11) I deleted all the files from Raspberry_Pi_1 folder and uploaded new set of slides, but  #
   system doesn’t show any rotating images?                                                 #
                                                                                            #
Ans. While deleting, you are not allowed to delete all files from Raspberry_Pi_1 folder.    #
     You should keep at least one file, before uploading any new files. After two minutes,  #
     you should delete that last one remaining. This is to make sure that Pi detects that   #
     you are making changes to the system. The window is 30 seconds on Pi. If you are making#
     even exchanges, that is deleting 1 image for the another, you better wait a minute,    #
     just to be sure.                                                                       #
                                                                                            #

                                                                                            #
1) Why do I see pop-up on the screen and signage files running behind it?                   #
Pop up can be caused by an application. For example, some one just used a TeamViewer on     #
the mac and on exit TeamViewer left a pop up. It can also be that the bluetooth is on       #
and a pop up searching for wireless mouse or keyboard comes up not the screen.              #
You can get rid of pop-ups by going under System Preferences, Notification, and             #
selecting Do Not Disturb. you can put the work time in there fro 8 AM to 8 PM, so that      #
during the operation hours in SPH there is no pop-ups on the screen.                        #
Having said that if someone do see an update notification, please feel free to update,      #
and then restart.                                                                           #
                                                                                            #
2) I uploaded the images, but old ones are still running?                                   #
Wifi isn’t connected. Turn off and on the Wifi switch on Mac                                #
                                                                                            #
3) Video or image file uploaded isn’t turning up?                                           #
MAC version of Digital_Signage will only play .jpg, .JPG and .mp4 files. If you have        #
uploaded any other format, it might or might not work.                                      #
                                                                                            #
4) Can I change the name of files and folder in dropbox after adding them?                  #
No, you cannot. You have to delete the file whose name is supposed to be changed and        #
upload again. This is because, the running application keeps count of number of files       #
not names of files.                                                                         #
                                                                                            #
5) Why is the synced folder name Dev?                                                       #
The project was in development phase, and since the decision was sudden to put into         #
production, the folders name couldn’t be changed. It is possible to change the names,       #
if a necessity arises.                                                                      #
                                                                                            #
6) Automatic deletion of files isn’t working properly?                                      #
You haven’t followed the correct naming convention.                                         #
Please refer Instruction for naming files.docx file in Dropbox account                      #
                                                                                            #
