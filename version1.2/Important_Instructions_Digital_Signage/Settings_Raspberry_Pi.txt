1) Most important: Every Pi has a number written on top of it. Please compile a list of all #
the Pi numbers and the associated TVs they are attached to. Kindly, share this file on      #
Dropbox under folder Important_Instructions_Digital_Signage folder in txt format named as   #
Pi_location.txt. (You might have to take down some of the PIs in order to the see           #
respective number)                                                                          #
                                                                                            #
Note 1: On LXTerminal, please type only the things that I have written inside the double    #
quotes (“ “). Double quotes are not to be typed anywhere.                                   #
                                                                                            #
Note 2: For completing all the below steps, all Raspberry Pis need not be taken down.       #
Please attach a keyboard and mouse to the Pi, and use TVs screen to see the Desktop view.   #
Also, for the Raspberry Pi on the TV on the bridge, you will have to take it down and       #
attach to a HDMI monitor to it to carry out the below listed steps. While taking down the   #
PI make sure you keeps the HDMI cord and Power Cord for Pi behind the TV within your reach  #
from the Bridge. In case if you don’t, then be prepared to use the ladder that Mark has     #
underneath the lecture hall.                                                                #
                                                                                            #
 Initially the Pi will be showing Images.                                                   #
                                                                                            #
->Press Esc key on keyboard. This will minimize the Image viewer window size                #
->Open LXTerminal form the start menu on the top left. (LXTerminal will probably be under   #
the others tab. If you don’t find it there, then try under other tabs. Some Pis have an     #
icon on Desktop itself)                                                                     #
->Type “cd ~/Desktop/DS_Code” and press enter.                                              #
->Type “bash teardown.sh” and press enter. This will close the Digital Signage running in   #
the background                                                                              #
->Type “clear” and press enter. Now move on to the other steps                              #
                                                                                            #
2) Setting the Root Password on every Pi.  (This is one time setup and is needed for me to  #
diagnose system in case if anyone messes up below steps)                                    #
                                                                                            #
->Open LXTerminal form the start menu on the top left. (It will probably under the others   #
tab. If you don’t find it there, then try under other tabs. Some Pis have an icon on        #
Desktop itself)                                                                             #
                                                                                            #
->Type, “sudo passwd root”                                                                  #
->Type the root password. ( I would suggest keeping password as “raspberrypi_1",            #
“raspberrypi_2”, and so on where no after the underscore is the Pi number)                  #
->You must enter it twice and press enter. (While typing the password, you won’t see the    #
password in clear text rather you will see *******)                                         #
                                                                                            #
3) Disabling the usb power sleeping mode?                                                   #
->Open LXTerminal form the start menu on the top left. (It will probably under the others   #
tab). (If it is already open, then go to the next step)	                                    #
->Create and edit a new file in /etc/modprobe.d/8192cu.conf. You can do this by typing      #
“sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/8192cu.conf” in the LX Terminal                                  #
->After this a embedded window will open. Please type the following                         #
"options 8192cu rtw_power_mgnt=0 rtw_enusbss=1 rtw_ips_mode=1” without the quotes           #
->Once the line is added, press ctrl + X . It will ask you to do you want to save file,     #
press Y.                                                                                    #
->You have successfully created the file now. Cross check it the file is there by typing    #
“cat  /etc/modprobe.d/8192cu.conf”. Look for the added content, if you can see the content, #
you are all set for this step.                                                              #
->Type “sudo reboot” and press enter. This will restart the system and Pi will again start  #
after sometime in Digital Signage Mode.                                                     #
                                                                                            #
4) Change the Wifi Password?                                                                #
->Go to start option on the top left.                                                       #
->Under the internet tab, locate wpa_gui or WiFi Config option and click on it.             #
->Go to Manage Networks                                                                     #
->Locate umd-secure. If you see one, then delete it using the - option at the bottom or     #
Remove button. (In case if umd-secure isn’t listed, then move to the next step)<<- Highly   #
Unlikely case                                                                               #
->See through all the tabs to locate Scan button.                                           #
->Once you click on scan it will list mud-secure. You may see many umd-secure network. You  #
can go with the one which has least negative number in Db (Decibel)                         #
-> Wifi Setting paramter ---> EAP Method = TTLS, Encryption = CCMP                          #
->Type “sudo reboot” and press enter. This will restart the system and Pi will again start  #
after sometime in Digital Signage Mode.                                                     #
                                                                                            #
