1) I uploaded the file in the dropbox, but it doesn’t turn up on TV?                        #
Ans. Probably, you had uploaded a file format that is not .jpg or .JPG. In case, if you     #
     see your file extension to be .jpeg, then just rename it to .JPG or .jpg 		    #
											    #
											    #
2) Pi Screen is frozen and it is struck at one image? 					    #
Ans. * Do a hard reset of Pi. That is, plug out the power cord and re-insert it. 	    #
     * Pi will restart after that, and you need to click on LXTerminal icon on the desktop. #
     * A black window will open,							    #
	1) Type cd Desktop and then press enter once					    #
	2) Type bash Digtial_Signage.sh and press enter. 				    #
											    #
    * You’ll be all set now. 								    #
											    #
3) I uploaded the images, but old ones are still running?				    #
											    #
Ans. * Please take a look at the Pi, if the wireless module doesn’t have blue light on,     #
       that means the Wifi is not working. 						    #
     * Plug out the Wifi module and again reinsert. Hopefully, it will catch the signal.    #
     * If the above doesn’t work, please do a hard reset of the Pi by plugging out the power# 
       cord.										    #
     * On startup screen, press the WifiConfig icon, and scan for wireless network.         #
     * On finding the umd-secure (SSID) press it and enter the sph-sc credential to access  #
       wifi. 										    #
     * Open LXTerminal from the Desktop, and type ping www.google.com. If you see a reply   #
       message form google.com, you are setup. If not, then try the above steps again.      #
     * After confirming that you are on Wifi, please repeat the Step (2)(as above) from     #
       third step which talks about black window.					    #
     * You’ll be all set now.								    #

4) I deleted all the files from Raspberry_Pi_1 folder and uploaded new set of slides, but   #
   system doesn’t show any rotating images?						    #
											    #
Ans. While deleting, you are not allowed to delete all files from Raspberry_Pi_1 folder.    #
     You should keep at least one file, before uploading any new files. After two minutes,  #
     you should delete that last one remaining. This is to make sure that Pi detects that   #
     you are making changes to the system. The window is 30 seconds on Pi. If you are making# 
     even exchanges, that is deleting 1 image for the another, you better wait a minute,    # 
     just to be sure.									    #

1) Why do I see pop-up on the screen and signage files running behind it?	            #
Ans. Pop up can be caused by an application. For example, some one just used a TeamViewer on#
     the mac and on exit TeamViewer left a pop up. It can also be that the bluetooth is on  #
     and a pop up searching for wireless mouse or keyboard comes up not the screen.         #
     You can get rid of pop-ups by going under System Preferences, Notification, and        #
     selecting Do Not Disturb. you can put the work time in there fro 8 AM to 8 PM, so that #
     during the operation hours in SPH there is no pop-ups on the screen.	            #
     Having said that if someone do see an update notification, please feel free to update, #
     and then restart.									    #	
											    #
2) I uploaded the images, but old ones are still running?				    #	
Ans. Wifi isn’t connected. Turn off and on the Wifi switch on Mac			    #
										            #				
3) Video or image file uploaded isn’t turning up?                                           #
Ans. MAC version of Digital_Signage will only play .jpg, .JPG and .mp4 files. If you have   #
     uploaded any other format, it might or might not work.                                 #
 											    #	
4) Can I change the name of files and folder in dropbox after adding them?                  #
Ans. No, you cannot. You have to delete the file whose name is supposed to be changed and   #
     upload again. This is because, the running application keeps count of number of files  #
     not names of files. 								    #
											    #	
5) Why is the synced folder name Concourse_TV and Raspberry_Pi_1?                           #
Ans. The project was in development phase, and since the decision was sudden to put into    #
     production, the folders name couldn’t be changed. It is possible to change the names,  #
     if a necessity arises. 								    #
											    #	
6) Automatic deletion of files isn’t working properly?					    #	
Ans. You haven’t followed the correct naming convention. 			            #
     Please refer Instruction for naming files.docx file in Dropbox account 		    #
